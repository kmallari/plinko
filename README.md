# Plinko
This repository contains a Plinko game inspired by [Stake.com's Plinko game](https://stake.com/casino/games/plinko). Since this version is not meant to be used for real gambling, the user can set their own balance to start playing the game.
## Features
* Easy Bet Modification
	* There are dedicated buttons to double or half your current bet. You can also just type your bet in the input box.
* Editable Rows and Risk
	* The website features changing the rows and risk of the game in real-time. As soon as you change these values, the changes will immediately reflect on the site. 
* Manual and Automatic Mode 
	* A manual mode is available wherein bets can be cast one by one. An automatic mode is also available, wherein the user can set how many bets they want to perform.
* Error Catching
	* If the user enters a bet higher than their balance, an error message will appear. For automatic mode, the error will appear if your bet multiplied by the number of automatic bets you want if higher than your current balance.
* Animation
	* Simple animations were implemented in the game to replicate how the Plinko game works.
